# ms-teams-orb
CircleCI Orb to handle Microsoft Teams notifications

This orb is based on the https://github.com/cloudradar-monitoring/circleci-orbs implementation.

It was customized to provide different default values for the typical use case, fix a bug in the message template color, and also improve the message facts.
